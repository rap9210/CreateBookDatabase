#BookDatabase
"Book Database creating using switch statements to 'set', 'get' methods to procure a particular piece of info from a book, and a method that returns all the info at once."
#Created a book class with manually stored books. Then created a database class with an arraylist of all the books in the book class. Then added a method in the database class to search for each book using an SKU input from the user and if not found display not found.
